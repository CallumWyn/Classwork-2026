/*   Structure for Stores(Store name, Open times, Number of Aisles)
     Structure for Aisles (Items in aisle, Amount of an item found in Aisle, Aisle number, Category of items in aisle,etc)
     Structure for Items (Name of item, Item Category, Item price, Item Size)
     Structure for basket (Area to store items, Amount of space)
     Structure for 
     
     GENERAL IDEAS
     Have a list of store names and program a way to randomly select one of them, along with their open times and Aisles
     The categories of the Aisles found in the store are randomly selected
     The Aisle struct will have a list that stores the Item structures that have matching categories
     Possibly make a function that automatically sorts Items into Aisles
     Possibly make a function that will calculate total cost. Could also just make a counter for that.

     Layout could be something like this:

     "Where would you like to go?"
     "Aisle 1 - Sweets"
     "Aisle 2 - Grains"
     "Aisle 3 - Medicine"
     "Aisle 4 - Dairy"

     Would also be nice to implement a method of viewing items in the basket

     "Basket"
     "Chocolate x1"
     "Bread Rolls x3"
     "Cheese x8"

     "Remaining Space:"
